Isotonic Position Control:
- just like positioning objects in the real world in all directions (pick up, move, place), for example, by dragging

Isotonic Rate Control:
- 

Isotonic Acceleration Control:
- like a gas pedal/throttle/accelerator in a car: the more you displace it, the higher the acceleration

Elastic Position Control:
- controlling the movement of the crane in the logistics facility, as it requires only one-dimensional movement

Elastic Rate Control:
