Isotonic Position Control:
- just like positioning objects in the real world in all directions (pick up, move, place), for example, by dragging
- mouse cursor in every operating system

Isotonic Rate Control:
- constant playback speed control: a student wants to review the course video with x1.5 speed, because of the lack of time
- volume control

Isotonic Acceleration Control:
- throttle lever in a plane

Elastic Position Control:
- controlling the movement of the crane in the logistics facility, as it requires only one-dimensional movement

Elastic Rate Control:
- playback speed control for video or audio (good for skipping some parts) : detectives investigating video and wants to pinpoint the moment where the suspect appears whilst fast-forwarding the video

Elastic Acceleration Control:
- like a gas pedal/throttle/accelerator in a car: the more you displace it, the higher the acceleration (ignoring friction)
